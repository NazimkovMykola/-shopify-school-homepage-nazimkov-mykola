2. SCSS (Sass): A CSS preprocessor that extends the functionality of CSS, allowing for the use of variables, nesting, and mixins. SCSS was used to write more maintainable and organized stylesheets.

2. Implement a slider for image previews instead of a static block. I couldn't do it due to conflicts in slider initialization.
