2. SCSS (Sass): A CSS preprocessor that extends the functionality of CSS, allowing for the use of variables, nesting, and mixins. SCSS was used to write more maintainable and organized stylesheets.

And also he HTML markup is fully valid and has been validated using the "W3C validator" tool - https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fshopify-school-homepage-nazimkov-mykola.onrender.com%2F

2. Implement a slider for image previews instead of a static block. I couldn't do it due to conflicts in slider initialization.
